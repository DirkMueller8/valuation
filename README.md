**Purpose**

The objective of this questionnaire software is to track the output of clinical collaboration sites, their added value and impact to Company, by giving numbers on a scale for each criterium. Company's contributions are also given as input. The formula to calculate the balance of in and output is not (yet) part of this software. The input and all associated information is collected in worksheet tables for further analysis.
