The objective of this questionnaire software is to track the output of clinical collaborative sites, their added value and impact to Company, by giving numbers on a scale for each criterium. They can then be later compared with the input (resources) supplied by Company with an algorithm not part of this software. The site owner gives input and all the information is collected in tables for further analysis.
