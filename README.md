**Purpose**

The objective of this questionnaire software is to track the output of clinical collaboration sites, their added value and impact to Company, by giving numbers on a scale for each criterium. Company's contributions are also given as input. The formula to calculate the balance of in- and output is not (yet) part of this software. The collected data and all associated information are placed in a worksheet table for further analysis.
